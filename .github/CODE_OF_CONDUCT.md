# Code of Conduct

If you use an LLM (Large Language Model, like ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot,
or Llama) to make a contribution then you must say so in your contribution and
you must carefully review your contribution for correctness before sharing it.
If you share un-reviewed LLM-generated content then you will be immediately
banned.
